# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Cloudflare team!
The submission is a bit complicated as this whole project has many different repositories, however decided to submit this one since it utilizes the amazing Cloudflare workers infrastructure in combination with the Cloudflare Pages.

## pacman-ai-api
The Javascript based API for the pacman service.
- Uses the amazing Workers infrastructure + Workers KV.
- Integrates with GitHub API for simple and easy use. Don't worry the secrets in the repo aren't real... or are they ðŸ¤¨. Jk they arn't. 


## Main Game code ðŸš€
To fully understand why this project is so cool see main repo here:
https://github.com/JamesWRC/pacman-ai

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Fun fact. 2 Aussie universities use this to help teach agent based AI.

## Why chose Cloudflare?
- Utilize serverless infrastructure hosted on the edge (200+ cities)
- Amazing pricing structure (only pay for compute time and not pay when making API calls like ol' mates Bezos's AWS Lambda) 
    - Seriously the fact that you dont pay for HTTP requests is a mazing and even using workers for professional services.
- Edge Key Value storage!

## Why make this?
I wanted to get out of my depth and dive in the deep-end with new technology, languages, frameworks and make services cost efficient.

As you can probably tell nmy code isnt clean in the slightest (yeah i know). It was a fun project and learned a lot!

## What have i learned?
- I wanted to try and use Cloudflare workers as a challenge and learn the benefits of serverless tech.
- Learned Javascript 
- Learned how cool a JAM stack is.
- Learned KV storage, its uses and its limitations.
- More about Git (since integrating this project into GitHub)
- More about cloud computing (thanks Bezos ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) )
- APIs integrating with browsers (CORS policies)
- Frontend development (Tailwind CSS is pretty damn cool)
- Learned Cloudflares values about privacy and security (love ya work... hire me?)
